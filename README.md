# AI-Class-Project
My final programming project for a class that focused on emerging AI trends.


Project Overview
This project showcases the development of a Pirate Intelligent Agent using reinforcement learning and neural networks. The goal was to train an AI to navigate a simulated environment, making decisions based on rewards and penalties. This involved applying key concepts from the course, including Q-learning, deep learning, and environment design in Python.

1. Work Summary
Given Code:
I was provided with a starter codebase that included the environment setup, basic reinforcement learning templates, and some utility functions to interact with the environment. This code helped initialize the agent and manage the state transitions and rewards.

Code I Created:
I implemented the following:

Reinforcement Learning Algorithm: Expanded the Q-learning algorithm to handle more complex state-action pairs and implemented a deep Q-network (DQN) using TensorFlow/PyTorch for decision-making.
Reward Function: Customized the reward function to balance exploration and exploitation, ensuring the agent could efficiently gather treasure and avoid obstacles.
Training and Testing Loops: Wrote scripts to train the model over multiple episodes and evaluate its performance based on success rates and cumulative rewards.
Documentation and Analysis: Created visualizations and logged results to analyze the agent's learning curve and decision-making process.
2. Connecting Learning to the Larger Field of Computer Science
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists develop algorithms, design software systems, and solve complex problems through computation. Their work is crucial for advancing technology, optimizing processes, and enabling intelligent systems like the Pirate AI agent. In this project, I applied these principles by designing an AI capable of learning and adapting to its environment autonomously.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approached the problem systematically:

Problem Analysis: Defined the agent's goal and the constraints of the environment.
Algorithm Selection: Chose Q-learning and neural networks to enable decision-making and adaptation.
Implementation: Coded and tested incrementally, ensuring each module worked before integration.
Optimization: Fine-tuned hyperparameters and reward functions to improve performance.
This methodical approach mirrors how computer scientists tackle real-world problems, balancing theory and practical implementation.
What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
When developing AI systems, it is essential to ensure they are:

Fair: Avoid biases in training data or decision-making.
Transparent: Provide understandable explanations for the AIâ€™s actions.
Reliable: Ensure the AI performs as expected under different conditions.
In this project, these principles were applied by carefully designing the reward system to prevent unintended behaviors and documenting the code and results transparently.
